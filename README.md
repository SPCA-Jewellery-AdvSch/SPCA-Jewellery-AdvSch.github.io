## SPCA Jewellery Fundraiser

The SPCA Jewellery fundraiser is a fundraiser for the SPCA, and it is run by a group of students in totora. We are all very passionate about arts and crafts, and we all love animals. We decided that we wanted to fundraise for all the unwanted animals in the SPCA, so we are selling jewellery after school on _ once a week. 70% of the profits we make will go to the SPCA, and 30% of the profits will go towards new equipment. the prices would range anywhere from 20c to $5.00. we have a range of products, from hand woven friendship bracelets, to charms and keyrings.

If you would like to order some thing, comment bellow the picture, and take the required amount of money to school next friday.
